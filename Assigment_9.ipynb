        "    Answer:  \n",
        "\n",
        "      A relative path refers to the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory or another reference point. Instead of specifying the complete or absolute path starting from the root directory, a relative path indicates the path relative to the current location or another specified directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "      For example, if the current working directory is /home/user/, the relative path documents/file.txt refers to a file named file.txt located in the documents directory within the current working directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Relative paths are typically shorter and more concise compared to absolute paths as they omit the unnecessary portions of the file system hierarchy. They are useful when you want to refer to files or directories within the same project or in relation to the current working directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "      It's important to note that the interpretation of relative paths depends on the current working directory or the reference point from which they are evaluated. Changing the working directory can alter the resolution of relative paths."

        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "        In most operating systems, an absolute path starts with the root directory. The root directory is the highest-level directory in the file system hierarchy and serves as the starting point for specifying the complete path to a file or directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Here are the conventions for absolute paths in common operating systems:\n",
        "\n",
        "        Windows: An absolute path starts with a drive letter (e.g., C:) followed by a colon (:) and a backslash (\\). For example, C:\\path\\to\\file.txt refers to a file named file.txt located in the to directory, which is inside the path directory on the C: drive.\n",
        "        Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux, macOS): An absolute path starts with a forward slash (/). For example, /home/user/file.txt refers to a file named file.txt located in the user directory, which is inside the home directory at the root of the file system.\n",
        "        In both cases, the absolute path provides a complete and unambiguous description of the file or directory's location, starting from the root directory and including all the intermediate directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "        It's worth noting that the format of absolute paths can vary slightly depending on the operating system, but the concept remains the same: an absolute path starts from the root directory and specifies the full path to a file or directory."
