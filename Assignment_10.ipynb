        "      The destination (dst) can be either the path of the directory where you want to place the copied file or the complete path and filename of the new file.\n",

        "\n",
        "      The shutil.move() function is commonly used to rename files in Python. Although its primary purpose is to move files or directories, it can also be used to rename files by providing the new destination path and filename.\n",

        "      Here's an example of how you can use shutil.move() to rename a file:\n",

        "\n",
        "      It's important to mention that shutil.move() can also be used to move files or directories to different locations. If the source and destination paths are within the same directory, the function effectively renames the file by keeping it in the same location but changing its name."
