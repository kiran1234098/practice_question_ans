        "\n",
        "    Using logging messages is generally considered better than using print() statements for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Granular Control: The logging module provides fine-grained control over log messages. You can specify different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) for different parts of your code. This allows you to easily enable or disable specific levels of logging, filter log messages based on severity, or redirect log output to different destinations (e.g., console, file) without modifying your code. With print() statements, you would need to manually add or remove them and potentially clutter your codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Flexible Output Handling: The logging module allows you to configure log output to multiple destinations, such as console, files, email, or even external log aggregation systems. It provides various logging handlers that offer different output options, formatting, and log rotation capabilities. On the other hand, print() statements are limited to printing messages to the console, requiring additional code to redirect output to different destinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Log Level Filtering: With logging, you can filter log messages based on their severity level. This allows you to control which log messages are displayed or recorded based on the desired level of detail. You can easily enable or disable debugging messages (DEBUG) in a production environment without modifying the code. With print() statements, you would need to manually comment out or remove the statements to disable them.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Logging Hierarchy: The logging module supports a hierarchical logger structure, allowing you to organize loggers in a hierarchy and set different logging levels at different levels of your application. This provides a more structured approach to logging, especially in larger codebases or complex applications. With print() statements, you would need to manually manage the hierarchy and logging levels, resulting in more effort and potentially less maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Logging Information Enrichment: The logging module allows you to enrich log messages with additional contextual information, such as timestamps, loggers' names, module names, line numbers, and custom fields. This can be extremely helpful in troubleshooting and understanding the context in which log messages were generated. print() statements, on the other hand, don't provide built-in mechanisms for such contextual information.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Performance and Production Readiness: The logging module is designed for efficient and scalable logging, making it suitable for production environments. It provides mechanisms for logging in a non-blocking manner, allowing your application to continue running smoothly even when handling a high volume of log messages. print() statements, especially when used extensively, can significantly impact performance, especially in long-running or performance-critical applications.\n",
        "\n",
